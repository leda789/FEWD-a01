FEWD assignment 1

## Introductions
Hello there, my name is Veda Farmer. I am a native of San Diego and I live in Clairemont. I am 22 years old and have a younger brother. I have two old black cats at home who get fed every day at 5:00pm. Here is a funny picture of a cat.

## Why I'm Here  
I was looking on the internet for different jobs when someone mentioned [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The Odin Project is a full stack web development course. I had no idea what web development was, but I could tell it was some type of coding, which I had an interest in. I made an account and started coding and I've enjoyed it ever since. Here are some things I enjoy about font end web development:  
- Changes can be seen almost immediately
- Names are intuitive
- Easy to look up questions in W3C
- Gives appreciation to good webpages you see
- Good creative outlet  

Nice to meet you all. I hope everyone here learns a lot and passes the class :)
